# Prague Congestion Control IETF Internet Draft

Contributions are welcome, either via a Pull Request here on github, or [other means](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/draft-briscoe-iccrg-prague-congestion-control-00#section-7)

This draft source is in V2 RFC XML, which can be [converted to various output formats ](https://xml2rfc.tools.ietf.org/) (guides to RFC XML are also via that link).
This repo doesn't use V3 RFC XML yet, 'cos my XML editor doesn't support it yet. But you can [convert to V3 temporarily](https://xml2rfc.tools.ietf.org/experimental.html), which is what I do before submitting to the IETF.
