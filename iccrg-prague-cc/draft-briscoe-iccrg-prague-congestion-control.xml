    <abstract>
      <t>{ToDo, something like:} This Informational/experimental RFC describes
      the Prague congestion control scheme, derived from DCTCP and adapted for
      Internet traffic by fulfilling the L4S Prague requirements. It reuses
      the DCTCP mechanisms to achieve high-burst tolerance, low latency, and
      high throughput on L4S supporting network nodes. Prague TCP is intended
      to be deployed on the Internet where it is compatible with TCP-Reno on
      drop based bottlenecks (AQM, policers or taildrop) and with L4S network
      support also on ECN based bottlenecks. Prague TCP can only achieve its
      low latency and high throughput when its packets are marked with a
      shallow ECN threshold and can only achieve its throughput fairness when
      a Coupled or FQ AQM mechanism is in place. For Classic ECN bottlenecks
      (RFC...) that are unaware of L4S, operators might want to apply
      additional measures to limit or avoid the higher throughput use of L4S
      Prague traffic. This memo presents the current state of the Linux Prague
      TCP implementation and some possible opprtunities for further
      performance improvements.</t>

            behaviour that can co-exist with standard TCP Reno <xref
            target="RFC5681"/> without causing significantly negative impact
            on its flow rate <xref target="RFC5033"/>. With Classic congestion
            controls, as flow rate scales, the number of round trips between
            congestion signals (losses or ECN marks) rises with the flow rate.
            So it takes longer and longer to recover after each congestion
            event. Therefore control of queuing and utilization becomes very
            slack, and the slightest disturbance prevents a high rate from
            being attained <xref target="RFC3649"/>.</t>

            <t hangText="Scalable Congestion Control:">A congestion control
            where the average time from one congestion signal to the next (the
            recovery time) remains invariant as the flow rate scales, all
            other factors being equal. This maintains the same degree of
            control over queueing and utilization whatever the flow rate, as
            well as ensuring that high throughput is robust to disturbances.
            For instance, DCTCP averages 2 congestion signals per round-trip
            whatever the flow rate. For the public Internet a Scalable
            transport has to comply with the requirements in Section 4
            of&nbsp;<xref target="I-D.ietf-tsvwg-ecn-l4s-id"/> (aka. the

        <section title="Accurate ECN Feedback">
          <t>When feedback of ECN markings was added to TCP <xref
          target="RFC3168"/>, it was decided not to report any more than one
          mark per RTT. L4S-capable congestion controls need to know the
          extent, not just the existence of congestion (Req 4.2. <xref
          target="I-D.ietf-tsvwg-ecn-l4s-id"/>). Recently defined transports
          (DCCP, QUIC, etc) typically already satisfy this requirement. So
          they are dealt with separately below, while TCP and derivatives such
          as SCTP <xref target="RFC4960"/> are covered first.</t>

          <section title="Accurate ECN Feedback with TCP &amp; Derivatives">
            <t>The TCP wire protocol is being updated to allow more accurate
            feedback (AccECN <xref target="I-D.ietf-tcpm-accurate-ecn"/>).
            Therefore, in the case where a sender uses the Prague CC over TCP,
            whether as client or server:<list style="symbols">
                <t>it MUST itself support AccECN;</t>

                <t>to support AccECN it also has to check that its peer
                supports AccECN during the handshake.</t>
              </list>If the peer does not support accurate ECN feedback, the
            sender MUST fall back to a Reno-friendly CC behaviour for the rest
            of the connection. The non-Prague TCP sender MUST then no longer
            set ECT(1) on the packets it sends. Note that the peer only needs
            to support AccECN; there is no need (and no way) to find out
            whether the peer is using an L4S-capable congestion control.</t>

            <t>Note that a sending TCP client that uses the Prague CC can set
            ECT(1) on the SYN prior to checking whether the other peer
            supports AccECN (as long as it follows the procedure in <xref
            target="I-D.ietf-tcpm-generalized-ecn"/> if it discovers the peer
            does not support AccECN).</t>

                <t hangText="TCP Prague in Linux  kernel:">The kernel had been

                So the kernel tries to negotiate AccECN exchange whichever
                congestion control module is selected. An additional check is
                provided to verify that the kernel actually does support
                AccECN, based on which the Prague CC module will decide to
                proceed using scalable CC or fall back to a Classic CC (Reno

                but the Prague CC module will always override this setting, as
                it depends on AccECN. Then, solely in this case, AccECN will

        <section anchor="pracc_moving_avg"
                 title="Moving Average of ECN Feedback">
          <t>The Prague CC currently maintains a moving average of ECN
          feedback in a similar way to DCTCP. This section is provided mainly
          because performance has proved to be sensitive to implementation
          precision in this area. So first, some background is necessary.</t>

          <t>The Prague CC triggers update of its moving average once per RTT
          by recording the packet it sent after the previous update, then
          watching for the ACK of that packet to return. To maintain its
          moving average, it measures the fraction, frac, of ACKed bytes that
          carried ECN feedback over the previous round trip. It then updates
          an exponentially weighted moving average (EWMA) of this fraction,
          called alpha, using the following algorithm:<list style="empty">
              <t>alpha += g * (frac - alpha);</t>
            </list>where g is the gain of the EWMA (default 1/16).</t>

          <t>Implementation notes:<list style="hanging">
              <t hangText="Rounding problems in DCTCP:">Alpha is a fraction
              between 0 and 1, and it needs to be represented with high
              resolution because the larger the bandwidth-delay product (BDP)
              of a flow, the smaller the value that alpha converges to (in
              steady state alpha = 2/cwnd). In principle, Linux DCTCP
              maintains the moving average 'alpha' using the same formula as
              Prague CC uses (as above). Linux represents alpha with a 10-bit
              integer (with resolution 1/1024). However, up to kernel release
              3.19, Linux used integer arithmetic that could not reduce alpha
              below 15/1024. Then it was patched so that any value below
              16/1024 was rounded down to zero <xref
              target="patch-alpha-zero"/>. For a flow with a higher BDP than
              128 segments, this means that, alpha flip-flops. Once it has
              flopped down to zero DCTCP becomes unresponsive until it has
              built sufficient queue to flip up to 16/1024. For larger BDPs,
              this causes DCTCP to induce larger sawteeth, which loses the
              low-queuing-delay and high-utilization intent of the
              algorithm.</t>

              <t hangText="Upscaled alpha in Prague CC:">To resolve the above
              problem the implementation of TCP Prague in Linux maintains
              upscaled_alpha = alpha/g instead of alpha:<list style="empty">
                  <t>upscaled_alpha += frac - g * upscaled_alpha;</t>
                </list>This technique is the same as Linux uses for the
              retransmission timer variables, srtt and mdev. Prague CC also
              uses 20 bits for alpha,</t>
            </list></t>

          <t>Currently the above per-RTT update to the moving average, which
          was inherited from DCTCP, is the default in the Prague CC. However,
          another approach is being investigated because these per-RTT updates
          introduce 1--2 rounds of delay into the congestion response on top
          of the inherent round of feedback delay (see <xref
          target="pracc_faster_response"/> in the section on variants and
          future work).</t>
        </section>

        <section title="Scaling Loss Detection with Flow Rate">
          <t>After an ACK leaves a gap in the sequence space, a Prague CC is
          meant to deem that a loss has occurred using 'time-based units' (Req
          4.3. <xref target="I-D.ietf-tsvwg-ecn-l4s-id"/>). This is in
          contrast to the traditional approach that counts a hard-coded number
          of duplicate ACKs, e.g. the 3 Dup-ACKs specified in <xref
          target="RFC5681"/>. Counting packets rather than time unnecessarily
          tightens the time within which parallelized links have to keep
          packets in sequence as flow rate scales over the years.</t>

          <t>To satsify this requirement, a Prague CC SHOULD wait until a
          certain fraction of the RTT has elapsed before it deems that the gap
          is due to packet loss. The reference implementation of TCP Prague in
          Linux uses RACK <xref target="I-D.ietf-tcpm-rack"/> to address this
          requirement. An approach similar to TCP RACK is also used in
          QUIC.</t>

          <t>At the start of a connection, RACK counts 3 DupACKs to detect
          loss because the initial smoothed RTT estimate can be inaccurate.
          This would depend indirectly on time as long as the initial window
          (IW) is paced over a round trip (see <xref
          target="pracc_flow_start"/>). For instance, if the initial window of
          10 segments was paced evenly across the initial RTT then, in the
          next round, an implementation that deems there has been a loss after
          (say) 1/4 of an RTT can count 1/4 of 10 = 3 DupACKs (rounded up).
          Subsequently, as the window grows, RACK shifts to using a fraction
          of the RTT for loss detection.</t>

      <section title="Congestion Response Algorithm">
        <t>In congestion avoidance phase, a Prague CC uses a similar additive
        increase multiplicative decrease (AIMD) algorithm to DCTCP, but with
        the following differences:</t>

        <section title="Fall-Back on Loss">
          <t>A Prague CC has to fall back to Reno-friendly behaviour on
          detection of a loss (Req 4.3. <xref
          target="I-D.ietf-tsvwg-ecn-l4s-id"/>). DCTCP falls back to Reno for
          the round trip after a loss, and the Linux reference implementation
          of TCP Prague inherits this behaviour.</t>

          <t>If a Prague CC has already reduced cwnd due to ECN feedback less
          than a round trip before it detects a loss, it MAY reduce cwnd by a
          smaller amount due to the loss, as long as the reductions due to ECN
          and the loss are Reno-friendly when taken together.</t>

          <t>See <xref target="pracc_delay-based"/> for discussion of future
          work on congestion control using a combination of delay, ECN and

        <section title="Multiplicative Decrease on ECN Feedback">
          <t>The Prague CC currently responds to ECN feedback in a similar way
          to DCTCP. This section is provided mainly because performance has
          proved to be sensitive to implementation details in this area. So
          the following recap of the congestion response is needed first.</t>

          <t>As explained in <xref target="pracc_moving_avg"/>, the Prague CC
          (like DCTCP) clocks its moving average of ECN-marking, alpha, once
          per round trip throughout a connection. Nonetheless, it only
          triggers a multiplicative decrease to its congestion window when it
          actually receives an ACK carrying ECN feedback. Then it suppresses
          any further decreases for one round trip, even if it receives
          further ECN feedback. This is termed Congestion Window Reduced or
          CWR state.</t>

          <t>The Prague CC (like DCTCP) ensures that the average recovery time
          remains invariant as flow rate scales (Req 4.3 of <xref
          target="I-D.ietf-tsvwg-ecn-l4s-id"/>) by making the multiplicative
          decrease depend on the prevailing value of alpha as follows:<list
              style="empty">
              <t>ssthresh = (1 - alpha/2) * cwnd;</t>
            </list></t>

          <t>Implementation notes:<list style="hanging">
              <t hangText="Upscaled alpha:">With reference to the earlier
              discussion of integer arithmetic precision (<xref
              target="pracc_moving_avg"/>), alpha = g * upscaled_alpha.</t>

              <t hangText="Carry of fractional cwnd remainder:">Typically the
              absolute reduction in cwnd is only a small number of segments.
              So, if the Prague CC implementation counts the window in integer
              segments (as in the Linux reference code), delay can be made
              significantly less jumpy by tracking a fractional value
              alongside the integer window and carrying over any fractional
              remainder to the next reduction. Also, integer rounding bias
              ought to be removed from the multiplicative decrease
              calculation.</t>
            </list></t>

          <t>In dynamic scenarios, as flows find a new operating point, alpha
          will have often tailed away to near-nothing before the onset of
          congestion. Then DCTCP's tiny reduction followed by no further
          response for a round is precisely the wrong way for a CC to respond.
          A solution to this problem is being evaluated as part of the work
          already mentioned to improve Prague's responsiveness (see <xref
          target="pracc_faster_response"/> in the section on variants and
          future work).</t>
        </section>

        <section title="Additive Increase and ECN Feedback">
          <t>Unlike DCTCP, the Prague CC does not suppress additive increase
          for one round trip after a congestion window reduction (while in CWR
          state). Instead, a Prague CC applies additive increase irrespective
          of its CWR state, but only for bytes that have been ACK'd without
          ECN feedback. Specifically, on each ACK,<figure>
              <artwork><![CDATA[    cwnd += (acked_sacked - ece_delta) * ai_per_rtt / cwnd;
]]></artwork>
            </figure>where:<list style="empty">
              <t>acked_sacked is the number of new bytes acknowledged by the
              ACK;</t>

              <t>ece_delta is the number of newly acknowledge ECN-marked
              bytes;</t>

              <t>ai_per_rtt is a scaling factor that is typically 1 SMSS
              except for small RTTs (see <xref
              target="pracc_rtt_independence"/>)</t>
            </list></t>

          <t>Superficially, the traditional suppression of additive increase
          for the round after a decrease seems to make sense. However, DCTCP
          and Prague are designed to induce an average of 2 congestion marks
          per RTT in steady state, which leaves very little space for any
          increase between the end of one round of CWR and the next mark. In
          tests, when a test version of Prague CC is configured to completely
          suppress additive increase during CWR (like Reno and DCTCP), it
          sawteeth become more irregular, which is its way of making some
          decreases large enough to open up enough space for an increase. This
          irregularity tends to reduce link utilization. Therefore, the
          reference Prague CC continues additive increase irrespective of CWR
          state.</t>

          <t>Nonetheless, rather than continue additive increase regardless of
          congestion, it is safer to only increase on those ACKs that do not
          feed back congestion. This approach reduces additive increase as the
          marking probability increases, which tends to keep the marking level
          unsaturated (below 100%) (see Section 3.1 of <xref
          target="Tensions17"/>). Under stable conditions, Prague's congestion
          window then becomes proportional to (1-p)/p, rather than 1/p.</t>

        <section anchor="pracc_rtt_independence"
                 title="Reduced RTT Dependence">
          <t>This section addresses the 'Reduced RTT bias' aspect of Req 4.3.
          [xref-ecn-l4s-id].</t>

          <t>The DCTCP AIMD algoritm described so far is roughly inversely
          proportional to RTT (rate =~ 1/RTT) and has 2 modes of operation for
          the marking probability p, depending on whether it is controlled by
          an immediate STEP AQM (on/off mode where rate =~ 1/p^2) or by random
          marker (where rate =~ 1/p). To completely remove the RTT factor from
          the equation in both modes, and to be compatible with a specific
          reference RTT RR, both the window update period and the alpha
          calculation period must be aligned with RR instead of the real
          measured RTT. To achieve this, the effective rate must be multiplied
          by a factor M = RR/RTT, a number bigger than 1 if RR is bigger than
          RTT. As the window W is still send within 1 real RTT, we also need
          to think in terms of a (non-existing/virtual) reference window RW
          which is RR/RTT times bigger than the actual window W. This RW would
          be the window that a flow with RTT = RR would have.</t>

          <t>So to make sure the same AI in terms of rate (only 1 segment per
          RW and per RR) is applied over a shorter W and RTT flow, only 1/M
          segment fractions can be added to W per RR (as W is send M times per
          RR). An additional 1/M reduction factor needs to be applied to W
          increase per RTT, as RTT is M times shorter than RR. This explains
          why we need to increase W only by 1/M^2 fractions per RTT. In effect
          this will result in only an extra segments send per RR. The increase
          algorithm is reusing the fractional increase value as explained in
          the previous topic. Similar for longer RTTs than RR, (RTT/RR)^2
          segments would need to be added per RR. The current Prague
          implementation does not support this faster AI for RTTs longer than
          RR, due to expected (though never evaluated) impact on latency
          overshoot and slowed responsiveness.</t>

          <t>The Linux Prague implementation uses a RR = f(RTT) to determin
          the reference RTT from the measured RTT. It implements 3 functions:
          f(RTT) = max(RTT, RR); f(RTT) = RTT + AdditionalRTT; f(RTT) = ...
          {ToDo}. The current default is f(RTT) = max(RTT, 25ms).</t>

          <t>To benefit from lower base RTTs the Reduced RTT Dependence
          algorithm only becomes gradual effective after a configurable amount
          D RTTs (current default 500). This means that initially the flow is
          as slow start responsive and gets an initial throughput based on its
          real RTT. Only after D RTTs the throughput will converge to the
          equal rate. The benefit is that short flows (mices) will get
          priority over longer flows, and shorter RTTs will still converge
          faster than longer RTTs. An idle reset time can be added. {to be
          verified...}</t>

      </section>

      <section title="Packet Pacing">
        <t>The Prague CC SHOULD pace the packets it sends to avoid the queuing
        delay and under-utilization that would otherwise be caused by bursts
        of packets that can occur, e.g. when a jump in the acknowledgement
        number opens up cwnd. Prague does this in a similar way to the base
        Linux TCP stack, by spacing out the window of packets evenly over the
        round trip time, using the following calculation of the pacing rate
        [b/s]:<list style="empty">
            <t>pacing_rate = MTU_BITS * max(cwnd, inflight) / srtt;</t>
          </list></t>

        <t>During slow start, as in the base Linux TCP stack, Prague factors
        up pacing_rate by 2, so that it paces out packets twice as fast as
        they are acknowledged. This keeps up with the doubling of cwnd, but
        still prevents bursts in response to any larger transient jumps in
        cwnd.<figure>
            <artwork><![CDATA[    if (cwnd < ssthresh / 2)
        pacing_rate *= 2;
]]></artwork>
          </figure></t>

        <t>During congestion avoidance, Prague does not factor up pacing_rate
        at all. This contrasts with the base Linux TCP stack, which factors up
        pacing_rate by a ratio parameter set to 1.2. The developers of the
        base Linux stack confirmed that this factor of 1.2 was only introduced
        in case it improved performance, but there were no scenarios where it
        was known to be needed. In testing of Prague, this factor was found to
        cause queue delay spikes whenever cwnd jumped more than usual. And
        throughput was no worse without it. So it was removed from the Prague
        CC.</t>

        <t>However, in the absence of hardware pacing, it becomes increasingly
        difficult for a machine to scale to higher flow rates unless it is
        allowed to send packets in larger bursts, for instance using
        segmentation offload. Happily, as flow rate scales up, proportionately
        more packets can be allowed in a burst for the same amount of queuing
        delay at the bottleneck.</t>

        <t>Therefore, the Prague CC sends packets in a burst as long as it
        will not induce more than MAX_BURST_DELAY of queuing at the
        bottleneck. From this constant and the current pacing_rate, it
        calculates how many MTU-sized packets to allow in a burst:<list
            style="empty">
            <t>max_burst = pacing_rate * MAX_BURST_DELAY / MTU_BITS</t>
          </list></t>

        <t>The Prague CC can use alternatives to the traditional slow-start
        algorithm, which use different pacing (see <xref
        target="pracc_flow_start"/>).</t>

        <t>It becomes increasingly difficult for a machine to scale to higher
        flow rates unless it is allowed to send packets in larger bursts, for
        instance using segmentation offload. Happily, as flow rate scales up,
        proportionately more packets can be allowed in a burst for the same
        amount of queuing delay at the bottleneck. Therefore, the Prague CC
        sends packets in a burst as long as it will not induce more than
        MAX_BURST_DELAY of queuing at the bottleneck. From this constant and
        the current pacing_rate, it calculates how many MTU-sized packets to
        allow in a burst:<list style="empty">
            <t>max_burst = pacing_rate * MAX_BURST_DELAY / MTU_BITS</t>
          </list> The current default for MAX_BURST_DELAY is 250us which
        supports marking thresholds starting from about 500us without
        underutilization.</t>
